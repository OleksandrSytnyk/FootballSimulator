# FootballSimulator
FootballSimulator is an application which simulates small football championship between 4-8 teams.
Scenario
* User enters the list of teams (not less than 4, but not more than 8)
* User clicks “Simulate” button
* User see the resulting table with sorted list: first team with highest score, last team with lowest
* User can start over the championship
Screens
* Splash screen should contain application name and description
* Home screen should consists of the list of selected teams, button “+” to add team and button “Simulate” to proceed to results. When no teams are added screen should contain text “Please add from 4 to 8 teams to start simulation” instead of the empty list
* Result screen should contain a resulting table (similar to Barclay’s Premier League) with next data:
  ◦ Position (#)
  ◦ Team name (Team)
  ◦ Games played (P)
  ◦ Game won (W)
  ◦ Game drawn (D)
  ◦ Game Lost (L)
  ◦ Points (Pts)
Main requirements
* Each team should play one game with all other teams. The results should be randomized
* Points calculation. Team gets 3 points for each won game, 1 point for drawn game and 0 points for lost one
* Team positioning. First place should take the team with the highest points score, last place with lowest
* If several teams have the same score then they should be sorted by the name in ascending order
Additional requirements (optional)
* Team names. Allow only alphabetic and numeric characters. Limit the team length by 25 characters. Allow adding only unique team names
*  Allow user to edit team name and remove teams from the list
*  Add additional columns to result table (after Game lost column and before Points column):
   ◦ Goals forward (GF) - the sum of goals team has scored
   ◦ Goals against (GA) - the sum of goals other teams has scored against current one
   ◦ Goals difference (GD) = GF - GA
Example
User has entered 4 teams:
* Team 1
* Team 2
* Team 3
* Team 4
According to the requirements next matches should be played in championship:
* Team 1 vs Team 2
* Team 1 vs Team 3
* Team 1 vs Team 4
* Team 2 vs Team 3
* Team 2 vs Team 4
* Team 3 vs Team 4
For instance, the results are:
* Team 1 2:1 Team 2
* Team 1 3:0 Team 3
* Team 1 7:2 Team 4
* Team 2 2:0 Team 3
* Team 2 4:1 Team 4
* Team 3 1:0 Team 4
	
So, resulting table should look like:

| 4 | Team 4    | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0   |

Additional requirements

| # | Team name | P | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |
|---|-----------|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|-----|
| 1 | Team 1    | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 3  |  9 | 9   |
| 2 | Team 2    | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 7  | 3  | 4  | 6   |
